# No_Show_Appointments
This data analysis was part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity

The data originates from Kaggle, it provides us with data on medical appointments in Brazil. The data gives us a bunch of different demographic data in an attempt to better understand what factors lead to patients who in most cases need some form of medical attention choose to no show to appointments that they initially booked.
